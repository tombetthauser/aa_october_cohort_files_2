app/views/layouts/ APPLICATION.HTML.ERB

    once we reach the features specs we should only have to work on views

    we start with the application.html.erb partly because this is one that doesn't have direct specs
    technically we could write all of this in seperate views but it's much more efficient to just do it here
    everything we'll write will be in the body but before the yield

    the first thing well want to write is a conditional that will either show the following buttons
    Sign Out if a user is logged in
    Sign Up and Log In if a user is not logged in

        first well make an if else using out logged_in? method from the application controller
        if it returns true that means a user is logged in
        first we'll display the username by running our current_user in erb tags and cakking .username on it
        then well create a form whose action will be the session_url and whose method will be POST
        then well make our hidden auth_token input
        then well make our hidden method DELETE input
        then all we need is the submit input with the right text inside
        make your best guess on text and then correct based on failures, they'll be obvious
        dont bother going into spec files

        if the logged_in? returns false well just display two a tags
        the first will have the text for logging in and will have an href pointing to new_session_url
        the second a tag will be for signing up a new user and will point to new_user_url

    The only other thing we'll want to do here is render any errors that are flashed
    Well also do this with a conditional

        to show all our flashed errors well first make a condition to check if any exist
        then we can open a ul and make a .each on the flash[:errors]
        for each of these errors well just make an li that has the error in it in erb tags
        then close everythign up and were done

    ~12min, not timing, no notes, talked through
    ~6.7min no notes, one bug forgot action in form, 2sec fix, talked through
    ~6.9min no notes, one capy name bug, 2sec fix, talked through




    <% if logged_in? %>
        <%= current_user.username %>
        <form action="<%= session_url %>" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
            <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
            <input type="submit" value="Sign Out">
        </form>
        <% else %>
        <a href="<%= new_user_url %>">Log In</a>
        <a href="<%= new_session_url %>">Sign Up</a>
        <% end %>

        <% if flash[:errors] %>
        <ul>
            <% flash[:errors].each do |err| %>
            <li><%= err %></li>
            <% end %>
        </ul>
        <% end %>
