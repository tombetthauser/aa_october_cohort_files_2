# Rail Olympics Practice

You will have **2 hours** to complete this evaluation. This evaluation consists
of 3 components:

1. [HackerRank](http://hr.gs/47327932-c36e-4b62-81d9-c6f7680fdd52) (password:
   `checkitout`)
2. [ActiveRecord Querying](./active_record_pt1/README.md)
3. [Building a Rails Project - Garden Party](./build_rails_project_pt2/GardenParty/README.md)

## Scoring and time estimates

| Component                | Maximum Points | Estimated Time (minutes) |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| HackerRank               | 54             | 30 min                   |
| ActiveRecord Querying    | 26             | 45 min                   |
| Building a Rails Project | 24             | 45 min                   |

A detailed breakdown of the point values within each component is available in
the instructions for the component. The maximum number of points for this entire
evaluation is **104**. Your final score will be calculated as the percentage of
points awarded over the maximum number of points:

`score = (total_points_awarded / 104) * 100`

The passing score for this evaluation is **80**.

## Submission

- Rename the directory `"#{first_name}_#{last_name}"`.
- **Remove the `tmp` and `vendor`** folders to ensure your file won't be too
  big.
- ZIP it (you can use OS X's built in zip functionality)
- Use either `.tar.gz` or `.zip`; no boutique formats please :-)

Good luck!
